    "## How OpenAI’s Pricing Works\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI models are priced based on the number of tokens used in requests and responses. Different models have different pricing structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Terms:\n",
    "- **Tokens**: A token can be as short as one character or as long as one word. For example, \"chatbot\" consists of two tokens: \"chat\" and \"bot\".\n",
    "- **Prompt tokens**: The tokens you send in your request.\n",
    "- **Completion tokens**: The tokens generated in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Pricing Overview:\n",
    "- **GPT-4**: More capable, higher cost per token.\n",
    "- **GPT-3.5**: Less expensive but still very powerful.\n",
    "- **Whisper**: Pricing is based on audio duration for transcription tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For up-to-date pricing information, visit the [OpenAI Pricing Page](https://openai.com/pricing)."

    "## Understanding API Token Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's API limits usage through tokens. Each API request consumes a certain number of tokens based on the input text (prompt) and the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation:\n",
    "If you prompt GPT-4 with a 50-token input and receive a 100-token response, you will have used a total of 150 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can monitor your token usage through the OpenAI dashboard. This will help you keep track of your monthly usage and ensure you don’t exceed the free-tier limits (if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: How to calculate token usage in Python\n",
    "from openai import OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming you have already set your API key\n",
    "client = OpenAI(api_key = \"your-api-key-here\")\n",

    "## How to Monitor Your API Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To track your API usage and costs, OpenAI provides detailed reports on the dashboard. Here's how you can monitor your usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Go to your OpenAI account**: Visit your [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage).\n",
    "2. **View daily and monthly usage**: You can view the number of tokens used each day and see a summary of total usage for the month.\n",
    "3. **Set usage limits**: You can also set soft limits to prevent exceeding your desired monthly budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to retrieve usage details programmatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Programmatically fetch usage stats\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "api_key = \"your-api-key-here\"\n",
